# MetaTag Music Organizer

A simple python script that organizes your music library by the artist and album using metadata tags from MP3 files.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install eyed3
   ```
2. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cmershon2/MetaTag-Music-Organizer.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd MetaTag-Music-Organizer
   ```
4. Modify the source and destination folder paths in the `main.py` script if needed.
5. Run the script to organize your music library:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
## Disclaimer

This script assumes that all MP3 files have valid artist and album metadata. Test on a small subset of your library before applying to the entire collection.
